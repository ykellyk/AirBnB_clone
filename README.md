Description:
------------
This project is the initial step towards building an AirBnB clone, a web application for managing property rentals. The primary focus is on creating a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module.

Command Interpreter:
---------------------
The command interpreter allows users to manage AirBnB objects by performing actions like creating new objects (e.g., User, Place), retrieving objects, performing operations on objects, updating object attributes, and destroying objects.

How to Start:
--------------
To start the command interpreter, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
$ ./console.py
